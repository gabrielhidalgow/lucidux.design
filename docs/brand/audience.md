## Ideal Client Profile

| Attribute | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Role** | Technical founder or solo developer |
| **Team Size** | 1-3 people |
| **Stage** | Built MVP, has users |
| **Tools Used** | Lovable, v0, Cursor, or similar AI tools |
| **Problem** | Working product but poor conversion/retention |
| **Need** | Design expertise without full-time hire |
| **Budget** | Project-based or retainer |

---

## Pain Points

1. **Polished but ineffective UI** — AI tools generate clean interfaces that don't convert
2. **No design expertise on team** — Technical skills, but missing UX/UI judgment
3. **Can't justify full-time designer** — Need expert help, not a permanent hire
4. **Unclear what's wrong** — Know something's off, but can't pinpoint issues
5. **Data without interpretation** — Have analytics but don't know how to act on them

---

## What They Value

- **Speed** — Fast turnaround, async communication
- **Expertise** — Real design knowledge, not just opinions
- **Data** — Evidence-based recommendations
- **Transparency** — Clear process, predictable outcomes
- **Results** — Measurable improvements in conversion/usability

---

## Not a Fit

- **Enterprises needing design systems at scale** — I'm a solo expert, not a team
- **AI tool adoption consulting** — I don't help you pick or learn tools; I fix interfaces
- **Full redesigns from scratch** — I optimize what you've built, not start over
- **Agencies looking for white-label work** — I work directly with founders
