# Lucidux Brand Strategy

> Clear UX/UI thinking for AI products

## Brand Foundation

### Core Positioning

**Name:** Lucidux
**Tagline:** Clear UX/UI thinking for AI products
**Domain:** lucidux.design

**Market Position:**
Lucidux brings clear UX/UI thinking to AI products through expert design judgment, systematic methodology, and data-driven validation.

### Key Differentiators

1. **Expert UX/UI judgment** — Spot visual/interaction issues instantly that AI tools miss
2. **Systematic methodology** — Evaluate against 50+ proven design principles
3. **Data-driven validation** — Confirm insights with user testing and analytics
4. **Complete expertise** — Strategy, flows, visual design, and interaction details

### Core Insight

Technical founders build with AI tools (Lovable, v0, Cursor) and ship polished interfaces fast. But polished ≠ effective. AI-generated interfaces consistently have UX/UI problems that require expert design judgment to identify and fix.
